Within a year, she was volunteering with World Vision, distributing food to fellow Burmese migrants. In 1999, she became a migrant health volunteer (MHV) and has spent the last twenty-five years working tirelessly to increase her community&rsquo;s access to local health providers.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">&ldquo;Back then, the migrant community here was in a very bad situation. When someone was sick, no one knew what to do, where to go, or how to access healthcare. A Burmese doctor working with World Vision came to our community to recruit MHVs. He asked, &lsquo;Do you want to help our people from Myanmar access healthcare?&rsquo; I knew I wanted to make sure my community knew how to take care of themselves when they were sick, so I became a volunteer,&rdquo; she recounts. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Marlar works part-time helping her daughter-in-law sell goods, but she devotes most of her time to her role as a MHV. &ldquo;Whenever World Vision asks me to go to the community, I go,&rdquo; she says. Her tasks vary daily: referring patients to Ranong Health Promotion Hospital, assisting them in communicating with hospital staff, providing counseling and education, and coordinating community outreach events focused on health prevention. She is the trusted member of the community for support, but it hasn&rsquo;t always been that way. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">&ldquo;When I started as a volunteer trying to spread information on health prevention, I was not accepted by the community. People would say &lsquo;Who are you and why are you here? Why are you telling us this information?&rsquo; But over time, we built a relationship. They saw that my intention was good, that I could provide helpful information, and they grew to know and trust me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Marlar finds comfort in World Vision&rsquo;s support, which has significantly increased access to healthcare in her community. &ldquo;I find people who are sick and need testing and treatment, but they don&rsquo;t have the money for it. I used to worry, &lsquo;How can I raise enough money to help this person? Who do I call for help?&rsquo; but now I know I can reach out to the World Vision team, and they will provide the support needed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0 c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Her experience underscores the vital role MHVs play in driving positive health outcomes for migrants and ensuring communities have access to essential health services.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">&ldquo;MHVs are the bridge between the health providers and the migrant community because government hospitals do not understand the community&rsquo;s language or needs. Volunteers are from the community; we know its characteristics and language, so we can help the hospital staff and patients understand each other. Without MHVs, the community wouldn&rsquo;t know what services exist at the hospital or how to prevent disease, and they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to communicate their symptoms to health staff or doctors.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">With over 20 years as a MHV, Marlar has countless success stories. She smiles and says, &ldquo;There have been many times I&rsquo;ve identified a case of TB in the community through outreach and referred the case to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment. Then I help support them with at-home DOT treatments. These people are often the main income generators for their families, so when I see them get treated and return to normal life and work, they are very thankful for me and I feel extremely proud to be part of this work.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">When asked about her dreams for the future, Marlar focuses entirely on her community. &ldquo;I am committed to helping my community be healthy. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m content with what I have in life; now the only thing I want is to learn more about how to take care of other people. I want to learn more about disease control and prevention so I can share this knowledge with my community. The situation in Myanmar is getting worse, and with that, more and more people are moving who don&rsquo;t know how to prevent disease or access health services. I want people in my community to be healthy, to be able to take care of themselves and access healthcare so they can work more, earn more, and send money home. With the support of World Vision, this is possible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 456.10px; height: 303.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 456.10px; height: 303.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Maung*</span><span class="c4">, Migrant Health Volunteer in Mae Sai </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Maung* moved to Thailand 35 years ago to flee the civil war in Myanmar. Aside from owning a small grocery shop, he dedicates the majority of his time to supporting the local ethnic minority migrant communities in Mae Sai. For the past six years, he has served as a World Vision migrant health volunteer (MHV), helping to increase access to healthcare for local migrants. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As president of Mae Sai&rsquo;s ethnic minority migrant organization, Maung&rsquo;s MHV journey started when a World Vision staff member approached him seeking </span><span class="c0">interorganizational </span><span class="c1 c0">collaboration. &ldquo;I wanted to work together, so I participated in World Vision&rsquo;s training to become a MHV where I learned a lot about disease control and prevention,&rdquo; he recalls.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">As an MHV, Maung educates the migrant community about diseases such as TB, dengue, and HIV, providing updates on outbreaks and teaching people how to protect themselves. &ldquo;During the rainy season, for example, dengue fever increases. So we focus on sharing information on dengue prevention with the migrant communities,&rdquo; he explains. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">For Maung, outreach is as enjoyable as it is critical. He smiles as he recounts, &ldquo;There are tens of thousands of migrant workers in Mae Sai alone. For International Migrants Day, we organized a huge event to bring them all together. I helped coordinate a campaign that combined health and disease prevention education with fun activities like football.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Maung underscores the importance of a structured approach when engaging with communities. &ldquo;Everytime we go to a specific community, we have to plan. We contact community leaders and decide on a date. Then the communities are very receptive. We can&rsquo;t just walk in; otherwise, we won&rsquo;t be accepted,&rdquo; he explains. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Over time, Maung has become a respected source of support within the Mae Sai migrant communities, and the trust he has built is deeply intertwined with trust in World Vision. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not necessary for me to be with the outreach group at all times because most of the people in the communities know the World Vision logo, especially the migrant workers. When they see the logo, they know World Vision comes to help without expecting anything in return.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Apart from outreach, Maung&rsquo;s deep connections with both the migrant communities in Mae Sai and his networks in Myanmar have been invaluable for referring migrant patients across the border to continue treatment. He recalls, &ldquo;One time, Mae Sai hospital called a World Vision staff member about a patient who needed to cross the border to go home to Myanmar. The staff called me and asked if I could help. Since I have strong connections on the Myanmar side, I was able to facilitate the referral safely and ensure the patient could continue receiving treatment at home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Reflecting on his life&rsquo;s path, Maung says. &ldquo;I came from an area of conflict in Myanmar, and now that I&rsquo;m happily settled in Thailand and have found peace, I want to give back by helping my fellow ethnic minority communities. If a member of the community comes to me needing support, I prioritize them. I will always do my best to share information so people know how to protect themselves from getting sick.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 241.00px; height: 361.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 241.00px; height: 361.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Noi*, Migrant Health Volunteer in Mae Sot</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0 c9"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Noi*</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was born and raised in Mae Sot&rsquo;s Karen migrant community, an ethnic minority group from Myanmar, and has dedicated a significant amount of time to volunteering and working for World Vision. She has served as a migrant health volunteer (MHV), worked as a World Vision staff member and now, after attending</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;university </span><span class="c0">in Bangladesh, has returned to the Mae Sot Health Post.</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Outside of this, she&rsquo;s a consultant for the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">In her role as a MHV, she primarily visits local and rural migrant communities to conduct outreach activities and training focused on health education, and disease control and prevention. She speaks Karen, Burmese, Thai and English, which gives her a unique ability to bridge language gaps between migrant communities and healthcare providers. It also means she&rsquo;s been able to build meaningful relationships with the local migrant communities and extend the reach of &nbsp;Mae Sot Health Post&rsquo;s services to otherwise hard-to-reach populations. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">&ldquo;MHVs are very important because the health posts and hospitals in Mae Sot don&rsquo;t have enough staff or resources to reach everyone, nor do they have the connections to the community that we do,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;When we give our time and support to the communities without expecting anything in return, it builds trust and allows the health post to reach significantly more migrants.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Noi has grown passionate about sharing her health knowledge with other MHVs and women in the community. Over the years, she&rsquo;s observed that most of the MHVs at Mae Sot Health Post are women, as men are more likely to secure full time paid work while women stay at home with their children. She&rsquo;s seen that many women in the community are eager to upskill to learn how to better help their community. &ldquo;After the health training sessions, the women are always so inspired to pass their knowledge onto the community,&rdquo; she says. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">When asked why she&rsquo;s decided to stay in Mae Sot instead of taking up one of the many job offers she&rsquo;s received in Bangkok, she says, &ldquo;This is my community, I was born and raised here and I want to give back. There are a lot of women here who are not documented and therefore have far fewer opportunities, so if I stay here I can help pass on everything I&rsquo;ve learned.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 220.00px; height: 326.77px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 220.00px; height: 326.77px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Aranya*, Migrant Health Volunteer in Tak District</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Aranya* Kitchadomrong is a migrant health volunteer at one of World Vision&rsquo;s Border Malaria Education Corner (BorMEC) sites in Tak district.
